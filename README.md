Prerequisites:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Modules: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Usage:
`python convert.py -name DECKNAME -savedObjectsFolder "Saved\Objects\Folder\\"`
* Deckname could be CRYX or something if you want to do each faction separately.
* If you don't provide your saved objects folder, it will save your deck JSONs to this directory and you will need to copy them over yourself. You'll need to enclose the directory name with quotes, and end with \\\ because I'm lazy.
